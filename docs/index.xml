      <description>We use the OpenAPI specification in rekor making it easy to create your own RestFul API client.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in developing an application that can store or retrive entries into a Rekor transparency log, we recommend you take a look at the swagger online editor.</description>

We have a docker-compose file available
A kubernetes operator
Or you could do this manually and build rekor yourself.
Manual Installation Create Database and populate tables Trillian requires a database, we use MariaDB for now (others to be explored later). Once this is installed on your machine edit the scripts/createdb.sh with your database root account credentials and run the script.</description>

      <description>sigstore is a project with the goal of providing a public good / non-profit service to improve the open source software supply chain by easing the adoption of cryptographic software signing, backed by transparency log technologies.
sigstore will seek to empower software developers to securely sign software artifacts such as release files, container images, binaries, bill of material manifests and more. Signing materials are then stored into a tamper resistant public log.</description>
