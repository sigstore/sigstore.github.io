We use the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) in rekor making it easy to create your own RestFul API client.

If you're interested in developing an application that can store or retrive entries into a Rekor transparency log, we recommend you take a look at the [swagger online editor](https://rekor.dev/swagger).
